1. Advanced Joins
Understanding various types of joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER, CROSS JOIN).
Complex join conditions and combining multiple tables.
Use cases: Combining data from multiple sources like sales, products, and customer tables.

2. Window Functions
ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), NTILE(): For ranking and pagination.
LEAD(), LAG(): To compare current row values with previous or subsequent rows.
SUM(), AVG(), COUNT() OVER(): To calculate running totals, moving averages, and partitioned aggregates without grouping.
Use cases: Ranking products, calculating moving averages, cumulative sums.

3. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
WITH clauses for creating temporary result sets that can be referenced in subsequent queries.
Recursive CTEs for hierarchical data (e.g., organizational structure, category trees).
Use cases: Simplifying complex queries, building hierarchical reports.

4. Subqueries and Correlated Subqueries
Non-correlated subqueries (in SELECT, FROM, or WHERE clauses) for filtering and creating derived columns.
Correlated subqueries for row-by-row processing.
Use cases: Filtering based on aggregates, retrieving data from related rows.

5. Aggregation and Grouping
GROUP BY with HAVING: Advanced filtering of aggregated data.
Grouping by multiple columns and grouping sets (using ROLLUP and CUBE).
Use cases: Reporting total sales by region, generating summary reports.

6. Data Partitioning
PARTITION BY: For breaking data into partitions to compute aggregates or rankings over subsets of the data.
Windowing functions often rely on partitions (e.g., calculating running totals per department).
Use cases: Analyzing data for different segments (e.g., sales per product category).

7. Optimizing Queries
Indexes: Understanding how indexes improve query performance.
Query Execution Plans: Reading and interpreting execution plans to identify performance bottlenecks.
Performance Tuning: Techniques like avoiding unnecessary SELECT *, proper indexing, and using joins efficiently.
Use cases: Optimizing performance for large datasets.

8. Handling Time Series Data
Querying time-based data effectively using DATEPART(), DATEDIFF(), and date functions.
Window functions for cumulative, rolling, or moving window analysis (e.g., 7-day averages).
Use cases: Analyzing trends over time (e.g., revenue growth by month).

9. Set Operations
UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT for combining result sets.
Use cases: Merging datasets from different sources or comparing datasets (e.g., customers who bought Product A but not Product B).

10. Pivoting and Unpivoting Data
PIVOT: Transforms rows into columns (e.g., converting sales data into a pivot table by month).
UNPIVOT: Does the reverse, turning columns into rows.
Use cases: Creating dynamic reports (e.g., monthly sales breakdowns).

11. Stored Procedures and Functions
Writing and optimizing stored procedures to automate complex reporting tasks.
Understanding user-defined functions (UDFs) for reusable logic.
Use cases: Automating recurring tasks (e.g., monthly reports), encapsulating business logic.

12. Error Handling
Implementing TRY...CATCH blocks for error handling within queries and procedures.
Use cases: Ensuring robustness in automated scripts and procedures.

13. Dynamic SQL
Constructing SQL queries dynamically using EXECUTE statements and stored procedures.
Use cases: Building flexible reporting queries that adapt to different user inputs (e.g., generating reports for various departments).

14. Data Import/Export
Using SQL to import/export data from/to different file formats (e.g., CSV, Excel) and connecting SQL with external tools.
Use cases: Preparing datasets for analysis in external tools like Excel or Power BI.

15. Advanced Data Types
Understanding and working with advanced SQL Server data types like JSON, XML, and Geospatial data.
Use cases: Parsing JSON data from APIs or handling geographical data for location-based analysis.
